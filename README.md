# Liveness-Detection
The model detects whether a person standing in front of the face detector is live (Real) or he is holding an image or video (Fake) of a person.

The main aim of this project was to improve the security of face recognition systems by detecting fake and real images and preventing spoofing attacks.
Spoofing is one of the major problems in Face detection Systems.
